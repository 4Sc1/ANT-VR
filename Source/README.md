# ANT-VR and ANT-R Data Analysis and Tools

Welcome to the ANT-VR and ANT-R data analysis and tools folder. In the spirit of open science, this folder contains source code for various components related to ANT-VR and ANT-R experiments. Please make sure to read the README.md files and license information in each subfolder carefully for detailed instructions and licensing terms.

## Folder Structure

- **Data-Analysis:** This subfolder contains source code created to analyze the data of ANT-VR and ANT-R experiments. It includes tools and scripts for processing and interpreting experimental data.

- **ANT-R Script Augmentations:** Augmentation code for integrating LSL4EPrime with the original ANT-R study source code, enabling event marker streaming via LabStreamingLayer.

- **LSL4EPrime:** Inside this subfolder, you'll find the source code for an add-in designed for E-Prime 2.0. This add-in can detect button presses within E-Prime and, more importantly, can stream event markers via LabStreamingLayer (LSL). This feature is not typically available in E-Prime 2.0, making it a valuable tool for synchronizing data in your experiments.

- **VR-App:** The VR-App subfolder contains the source code for the ANT-VR application. This application plays the central role in your VR experiments, and the source code is provided here for customization and further development.
