# ResultTranslation and R-Project Folders

This folder contains two sub folders: ResultTranslation and R-Project, each serving a specific purpose in the context of analyzing and translating results from ANT-VR experiments. Before using the code and resources within these folders, please make sure to read the accompanying README.md files and LICENSE.txt files for each folder.

## ResultTranslation Folder

The **ResultTranslation** folder contains C# code for the translation of JSON results files produced by the ANT-VR into text files of the same structure that can be exported from E-Prime 2.0. This code is designed to assist you in converting ANT-VR experiment data into a format that is compatible with E-Prime 2.0, which may be useful for further analysis or comparison.

### Instructions
1. Navigate to the **ResultTranslation** folder.
2. Refer to the README.md file in this folder for detailed instructions on how to use the C# code to perform the translation.
3. Make sure to review the LICENSE.txt file to understand the terms and conditions of using this code.

## R-Project Folder

The **R-Project** folder contains R code for conducting a comprehensive analysis of the ANT-R and ANT-VR experiment results. This code is designed to help you process and analyze the data obtained from these experiments using the R programming language.

### Instructions
1. Navigate to the **R-Project** folder.
2. Refer to the README.md file within this folder for detailed instructions on how to use the R code to perform a full analysis of the ANT-R and ANT-VR results.
3. Ensure that you read and comply with the terms outlined in the LICENSE.txt file associated with this code.

Before using any of the code or resources provided in this folder, it is crucial to thoroughly review the README.md files and LICENSE.txt files in both the ResultTranslation and R-Project folders.
These documents contain essential information, usage guidelines, and licensing terms that must be followed during the use of the code and associated resources.
