# VR-Processor and VR-UnitTest

## Introduction
This code is designed to help you process and translate results from the ANT-VR application. The primary goal is to convert the JSON-formatted results into text files, which are in the same format as those produced when exporting results from ANT-R in E-Prime 2.0.
We will provide a Python version of this code ASAP.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or later.

### Setting up the Project
1. Open the `ResultTranslator.sln` solution file in Visual Studio 2019 or a later version.
2. You may need to update NuGet packages if newer versions are available. To update NuGet packages:
3. Please ensure that you have a compatible .NET Framework version installed in your Visual Studio. The code may work with different versions of the .NET Framework, but it is recommended to use the latest version compatible with your Visual Studio.

## Running the ResultTranslator

### ResultTranslator
The `ResultTranslator project contains the script that performs the result translation. To execute it:

1. Open the `ResultTranslator.sln` project in Visual Studio 2019 or a later version.
2. Navigate to the `ResultTranslator.py` file.
3. Run the Python script in the file.

## Result Translation

The script in the Python project will process the JSON-formatted results from the ANT-VR application and generate text result files similar to those produced by ANT-R in E-Prime 2.0. The translated result files will be available in a specified output directory.
