# E-Prime Script Augmentations

Welcome to the `E-Prime Script Augmentations`folder within the ANT-VR repository. This folder houses the augmentation source code for Jin Fan's original ANT-R (Attention Network Test - Revised) script, designed for E-Prime. Our augmentations enable E-Prime 2 to stream event markers via LabStreamingLayer (LSL), which is critical for EEG analysis.

## Contents Overview

- **Augmentation Source Code:** The core code necessary for augmenting the original ANT-R E-Prime script, enabling it to send real-time event markers to LSL, facilitating synchronization with EEG data.

## Purpose of the Augmentations

These augmentations are specifically designed to allow E-Prime 2 to interface with LabStreamingLayer. This functionality is vital for researchers conducting EEG studies, as it allows for the precise synchronization of behavioral data (from E-Prime) with EEG data. This synchronization is crucial for accurate and meaningful EEG analysis.
