## Quality of Experience Questionnaire

The questionnaire provided in this repository is an adapted version of the one originally developed by Brunnström, Dima, E., Qureshi, T., Johanson, M., Andersson, M., & Sjöström, M. in their 2020 research paper titled "Latency impact on Quality of Experience in a virtual reality simulator for remote control of machines," published in Signal Processing: Image Communication (Vol. 89, 116005).

### Adaptation and Usage

Our adaptation of the original questionnaire was designed to align more closely with the specific objectives and parameters of the ANT-VR study. While the core structure and key elements of the original questionnaire have been retained, modifications were made to suit our study's context and the particular aspects of VR experiences we aimed to evaluate.
